### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rambo1111/folder_tree_generator.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd folder-tree-generator
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    This will install the `@tauri-apps/cli` needed to run the project.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    This command will launch the application with hot-reloading enabled for easy development.

    ```bash
    npm run tauri dev
    ```

## Building for Production

To build the final, distributable application (e.g., an `.msi` installer for Windows), run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Once the build is complete, you can find the installer/application bundle in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` directory.
